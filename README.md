# Nordic Node

## Objectives

- Use Node to run JavaScript files
- Practice separating JavaScript code into modules
- Review JavaScript functions & objects

## Introduction
Node is just a program that runs javascript code on your computer, instead of in the browser. 

To run a file on your computer (server-side), you will type `node` and then type the name of the file you would like to run. For example: `node get-started.js` will run the code in the `get-started.js` file.
